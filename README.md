# Description 
Propel is an educational gaming application designed to help children and people who suffer from the condition of dyscalculia. The application was mainly constructed using `Pygame`, a `Python` library used for game development. Things such as music, text, buttons, games, timers, etc. were made using `Pygame`. For the login/create account system we used `MySQL`, a data management system to hold and save data within the game.

### Counting Game 
Students are to count the numbers using a method of counting called touch counting. It is used in classrooms to help people with dyscalculia (a learning disability which hampers mathematical ability), found here.

### Shape Game 
Shape accuracy, draw the outlines of a shape by plotting the points and comparing your drawing to the original shape. Increase your spatial memory and intuition.

### Adding Game 
Adding game, students can practice their addition skills with the assistance of drawing objects to complement their learning.

# Configuration 
Clone repository onto your local computer and open into your IDE. Tested on `Windows 10`. Created using `Python 3.10`. 
If not installed using `pip` install `Pygame`, `MySQL`, and `Pathlib`. 
Download `MySQL` workbench and install `MySQL` on your computer. For further information on installation of `MySQL` consult main website: `https://www.mysql.com/downloads/` 

When you open up the application you will be greeted with a front page. To play the games, simply press the play button and select the category of game you would like. 

Saving progress can be done by creating an account. To create an account go to the front page and click the top-right button, "Create Account" and enter in your information. Then, log in by pressing the "login" button in the front page. 

# Skills Demonstrated/Learned 
- Setting up database and managing databases using `MySQL` 
- Organizing a large amount of files and implementing them in code effictively using `Pathlib` 
- Advanced knowledge of classes and object oriented programming concepts 
- Collaborating with multiple programmers uisng Github and Git.
